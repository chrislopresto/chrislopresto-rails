  I grew up playing piano and have a jazz performance degree. I play several other instruments and have worked as
  a freelance session musician with independent and major label recording artists.

  In February 2010, Epic Records assembled a band for Roc Nation recording artist Hugo. I played keyboards and
  sang background vocals. We toured the US with bands like The Script and One Eskimo, playing in iconic venues
  throughout the country. We also performed in one of the Olympic arenas in Beijing.
